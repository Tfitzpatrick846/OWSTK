# OneWeb STK Module

A variety of people and groups within OneWeb use STK for analysis. 
Most of them rely on Python or MATLAB interfaces to automate the
setup or data collection and to then postprocess that data outside
of STK.  This project is an attempt to create a collaborative tool
for connecting to STK, defining objects, and performing analyses to
improve the connection between groups and reduce redundant effort.

owstk is a Python3 module.
